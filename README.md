_anvil_designer
================================
This is part of a set of repositories for the Test Driven Development of anvil.works apps.

It generates mock classes of [anvil.works](https://anvil.works/docs/api) for use in  [anvil_works_design_test](https://github.com/benlawraus/anvil_works_design_test)
scaffold, running on a local computer.

It belongs with the following repositories:

- [anvil_works_design_test](https://github.com/benlawraus/anvil_works_design_test)
The top level repository used as scaffold
- [anvil](https://github.com/benlawraus/anvil) Mock classes for anvil.works
- [_anvil_designer](https://github.com/benlawraus/_anvil_designer)
used to generate client_code mock classes
- [yaml2schema](https://github.com/benlawraus/yaml2schema)
used to convert `anvil.yaml` to a database schema
- [anvil_extras](https://github.com/benlawraus/anvil_extras)
used to add test functionality to anvil.works




It is a work in progress.
